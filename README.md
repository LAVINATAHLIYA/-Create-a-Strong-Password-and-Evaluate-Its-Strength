# -Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength
Testing how complexity affects password security using strength checkers and attack research.

## Key Findings  
- **Length > Complexity**: 16-character passwords resist brute force longer than short complex ones.  
- **Symbols & Randomness**: `T#7mX$9qLp2!` scored "Strong" vs. `Summer2024!` ("Moderate").  
- **Common Attacks**: Brute force cracks weak passwords in seconds; dictionary attacks exploit patterns.  

## How to Use  
1. Review password samples in `/passwords`.  
2. See strength test results in `strength_results.md`.  
3. Explore mitigation strategies in `/research`.  

> **Tip**: Use a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden) for secure generation/storage.
